# 🧠 AI-Powered Market Research System

Complete guide to the intelligent trading system using Perplexity AI and Claude AI.

## Overview

This system combines:
- **Perplexity AI** - Automated news gathering and research
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Deep market analysis and decision making
- **Algorithmic Analysis** - Traditional technical indicators
- **Smart Routing** - Uses each tool only when needed (cost-efficient)

## How It Works

```
Morning (8:00 AM):
├─ Perplexity searches news for each instrument
├─ Finds: earnings, economic data, geopolitical events
└─ Caches research for the day

During Trading (Every 60s):
├─ Algorithm analyzes technicals (RSI, MA, etc.)
├─ If signal is borderline (50-80% confidence)
│  ├─ Calls Claude with news context
│  ├─ Claude analyzes: news + technicals
│  ├─ Provides: BUY/SELL/HOLD + reasoning
│  └─ Overrides algorithm if needed
└─ Executes trade if confidence >= threshold
```

## Cost Management

### Smart Usage Strategy

**Conservative** ($5-10/month):
```json
{
  "ai_research": {
    "claude_for_borderline_only": true,
    "min_confidence_for_claude": 55,
    "max_confidence_for_claude": 75
  },
  "trading_settings": {
    "check_interval_seconds": 120  // Check less often
  }
}
```

Expected API calls:
- Perplexity: 5 calls/day (morning research) = 150/month
- Claude: 10-20 calls/day (borderline signals) = 300-600/month
- **Total cost: $5-10/month**

**Aggressive** ($20-30/month):
```json
{
  "ai_research": {
    "claude_for_borderline_only": false,  // Use Claude for all trades
    "min_confidence_for_claude": 40,
    "max_confidence_for_claude": 100
  },
  "trading_settings": {
    "check_interval_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

Expected API calls:
- Perplexity: 5 calls/day + 10 breaking news = 450/month
- Claude: 30-50 calls/day (all significant signals) = 900-1500/month
- **Total cost: $20-30/month**

### Monitoring Costs

Track API usage in logs:
```
2025-10-27 10:30:48 - INFO - 🎯 AI Decision: BUY at 75.0% confidence
  Tokens used: 1,247 (~$0.015)
```

Monthly cost tracking:
```bash
# Count Claude calls in logs
grep "AI Decision" logs/dashboard.log | wc -l

# Estimate cost (assume $0.01 per call average)
# calls_per_day × 30 × $0.01 = monthly cost
```

## What the AI Analyzes

### Perplexity Research

**Morning Research Query:**
```
What are the most important news and events affecting [NASDAQ 100] today?
Include:
- Major economic data releases
- Central bank announcements
- Corporate earnings
- Geopolitical events
- Market sentiment

Focus on information from the last 24 hours.
```

**Returns:**
- News summary (2-3 paragraphs)

### Claude Analysis

**Inputs to Claude:**
- Current price
- Technical indicators (RSI, MA, BB)
- News context from Perplexity
- Recent price action

**Claude Provides:**
- Clear decision: BUY / SELL / HOLD
- Confidence percentage
- 3-5 bullet point reasoning

- Risk assessment

**Example Claude Response:**
```
DECISION: BUY
CONFIDENCE: 72%

REASONING:
- Apple's AI chip announcement is bullish catalyst for tech sector
- Technical setup strong: RSI at 58, MA(20) > MA(50) showing uptrend
- Price testing resistance at 20,100 - breakout likely given positive sentiment
- Options flow shows heavy call buying, supporting bullish thesis

TRADE SETUP:
Entry: 20,150
Stop Loss: 20,050 (100 points risk)
Take Profit: 20,350 (200 points reward)
Risk/Reward: 1:2

RISKS:
- Federal Reserve commentary this afternoon could dampen enthusiasm
- Overbought conditions on hourly timeframe suggest pullback possible
```

## Real-World Example

**Scenario: US Tech 100 Trading**

**8:00 AM - Pre-Market Research:**
```
Perplexity finds:
"Apple announces revolutionary AI chip beating expectations.
Nvidia reports strong earnings. Tech sector sentiment positive.
However, Fed meeting today at 2 PM - hawkish comments expected."
```

**10:30 AM - Algorithm Detects Signal:**
```
US100:
- Price: 20,150
- RSI: 62 (neutral)
- MA(20) > MA(50) (bullish)
- Algorithm confidence: 65% (borderline)
```

**10:30 AM - Claude Called:**
```
Claude analyzes news + technicals:
"BUY with caution. Positive tech news supports upside,
but close position before 2 PM Fed meeting.
Confidence: 70% (reduced due to Fed risk)"

Recommendation: Buy 0.5 lots, exit before Fed at 1:50 PM
```

**10:31 AM - Trade Executed:**
```
BUY 0.5 lots US100 @ 20,150
Stop: 20,050
Target: 20,300
```

**1:50 PM - Pre-Event Exit:**
```
Close position @ 20,220 (+70 points profit)
Reason: Fed meeting risk
Result: +$35 profit, avoided Fed volatility
```

**2:15 PM - Post-Fed:**
```
Market drops 150 points on hawkish Fed comments
AI system saved from -$75 loss by early exit
Net benefit: $110 ($35 profit + $75 avoided loss)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Perplexity API key not set"

```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep PERPLEXITY

# Should show:
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxx

# If missing, add it:
echo "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
```

### "Anthropic API key not set"

```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC

# Should show:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx

# If missing, add it:
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
```

### No Pre-Market Research Running

Check configuration:
```json
{
  "ai_research": {
    "enabled": true,  // Must be true
    "pre_market_research_time": "08:00"  // Check time format
  }
}
```

Check logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/dashboard.log | grep "pre-market"
```

### Claude Not Being Called

This is normal if:
- Algorithm confidence > 80% (already sure, don't need Claude)
- Algorithm confidence < 50% (too weak, not worth trading)
- Signal is HOLD (no trade opportunity)

Claude is only called for borderline cases (50-80% confidence) by default.

To use Claude more:
```json
{
  "ai_research": {
    "claude_for_borderline_only": false,  // Use for all
    "min_confidence_for_claude": 40,
    "max_confidence_for_claude": 100
  }
}
```

### API Rate Limits

**Perplexity Limits:**
- Free: 5 requests/minute
- Standard ($20/month): 50 requests/minute

If hitting limits, increase `check_interval_seconds`.

**Claude Limits:**
- Tier 1: 50 requests/minute
- Tier 2: 1000 requests/minute

Unlikely to hit unless checking every few seconds.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative

First week:
```json
{
  "ai_research": {
    "enabled": true,
    "claude_for_borderline_only": true
  },
  "trading_settings": {
    "auto_trade": false,  // Manual approval
    "min_confidence_threshold": 75  // High bar
  }
}
```

### 2. Monitor AI Decisions

Compare AI vs Algorithm:
```bash
# Count how often Claude changed the decision
grep "AI Decision" logs/dashboard.log | grep -v "HOLD"
```

Track performance:
- Did Claude improve win rate?
- Did it help avoid bad trades?
- Is it worth the cost?

### 3. Adjust Based on Results

If Claude adds value:
- Increase confidence range
- Use for more instruments
- Check more frequently

If not adding value:
- Reduce confidence range
- Use only for major instruments
- Disable and save money

### 4. Cost Control

Set monthly budget:
```bash
# Track spending
echo "Budget: $10/month = ~1000 Claude calls"
echo "Current usage: $(grep 'AI Decision' logs/dashboard.log | wc -l) calls"
```

If approaching limit:
- Increase `min_confidence_for_claude` to 60+
- Reduce check frequency
- Limit to best instruments only

## Advanced Features

### Custom Research Queries

Edit `market_research.py`:

```python
# Add custom research for specific events
async def research_fed_meeting():
    query = """
    What is the market expecting from today's Federal Reserve meeting?
    Include rate decision expectations and potential market impact.
    """
    return await researcher.search_news_perplexity(query)
```

### Breaking News Alerts

The system automatically checks for breaking news every 15 minutes.

To trigger immediate check:
```python
# In dashboard or MCP tool
breaking_news = await researcher.check_breaking_news("US100")
if breaking_news:
    # React to news
    pass
```

### Historical Research

Query past events:
```python
query = "How did NASDAQ 100 react to previous Apple product launches?"
result = await researcher.search_news_perplexity(query)
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need both Perplexity and Claude?**
A: Technically no. You can use just Claude (it has some general knowledge) or just Perplexity (for research only). But together they're most powerful - Perplexity gets latest news, Claude analyzes it.

**Q: Can I use free tiers?**
A: Perplexity has limited free tier. Claude requires paid API. For serious trading, paid plans recommended.

**Q: Will this make me profitable?**
A: No system guarantees profit. AI improves decision quality but markets are uncertain. Use proper risk management.

**Q: How do I know if AI is working?**
A: Check logs for "AI Decision" messages. Compare trades with/without AI. Track win rate and profit factor.

**Q: Can I use other AI models?**
A: Yes! Edit `market_research.py` to use GPT-4, Gemini, or local models. Claude recommended for quality.

**Q: Is my API key secure?**
A: Keys stored in `.env` file (not committed to git). Use environment variables for extra security.

**Q: What if API is down?**
A: System falls back to algorithmic analysis. Trading continues without AI.
